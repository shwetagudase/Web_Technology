Event is an Action that happens in the browser. 
    eg: clicking a button, moving mouse, pressing key, submitting form, loading page.
Js can detect these events and responds to them 
types of event :
    1) mouse event - click,dblclick,mouseover,mouseout
    2) keyboard event- keydown,keyup
    3) brower event - load resize,scroll
                <img id="tiger"
                src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546182990-dffeafbe841d"
                alt="Tiger" onclick="alert('hii')"> 
                this is not a good way coz 
                html should contain strct and js contain logic.
                it is hard to maintain in big projects
good way : in script tag 
    <script>
    document.getElementById('japan').onclick=function(){
        alert('japan')
    } 
    select element to assign function to click event when clicked function run.
    only one event can be assigned can not handle multiple events/listerns properly.
    document.getElementById('japan').

    activity:
    jquery 
    type 
    timestamp
    default prevented
    target
    src element 
    current target
    client x 
    client y
    screen x
    screen y 
    alt ,ctrl,shift keys 

addEventListener : is a JS method used to attach an event handler to an HTML elemt so that specific function runs when a particular method occurs 
event goes to inner  element to parent and parent to document 
 false:child to parent //event propagation
 true:parent to child // event capturing
